I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Oklahoma working under the supervision of <a href="https://jachavezd.wasmer.app">Dr. Chavez Dominguez</a>. I hold a BS in Mathematics from the University of Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of quantum information theory and the applications of quantum computation. Beyond research, I’m committed to clear mathematical communication, collaborative problem‑solving, and building supportive academic communities.
