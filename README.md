<p align="center">
I’m Jeremiah Isu, a mathematics PhD student at the University of Oklahoma specializing in quantum information theory. My research focuses on the mathematical foundations of quantum information theory. I hold a BS in Mathematics from the University of Port Harcourt (Nigeria) and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma. My broader interests include quantum tomography, quantum computation, and the interplay between abstract theory and computational verification. Beyond research, I’m committed to clear mathematical communication, collaborative problem‑solving, and building supportive academic communities.
